# Q.3: Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples
# are similar.

# Differences:
# -Lists are mutable while tuples are immuatable.
# -Lists use [] while tuples use ()

# Similarities
# - Both lists and tuples are sequences meaning that the indexing of their elements has to be ordered.
# - Both lists and tuples are non-primitive.
# - Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be the same type.
