# Q.10: Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order.
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = {'Chris', 'Claire', 'Karis', 'Karl',
         'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor'}
print(names)

# This will not print in alphabetical order because sets are unordered collections.
