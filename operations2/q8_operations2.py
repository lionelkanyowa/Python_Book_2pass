# Q.8 To what value does the following expression evaluate?

'12' < '9'

# The expression above would evaluate to True. Even though these are strings, the digit values are still compared
# against each other by Python performing a character by character comparison.
# In this situation the evaluation starts by comparing each of the first digits.
