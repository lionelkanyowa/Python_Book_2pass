# Q.5 Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length?
# For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])  # will this result in an error?

# We get an error stating that 'list index out of range. This is because the list's index only goes up to 2 and there
# no string element to referenced on the 3rd index.
