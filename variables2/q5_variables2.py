# Q.5 Write a program named greeter.py that greets 'Victor' three times. Your program should use a variable and not hard
# code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. Here's an example run of the program:

name = 'Victor'                  # Created a variable that holds the value 'Victor'
print(f'Good Morning, {name}.')
print(f'Good Afternoon, {name}.')
print(f'Good Evening, {name}. ')  # used f-string interpolation
