# Q.3: Without running this code, what will it print? Why?

dict1 = {
    "Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy": 42,
    'Monty Python': 'The Life of Brian',
    'Airplane!': "Don't call me Shirley",
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict2['Monty Python'] = 'Holy Grail'
print(dict1['Monty Python'])

# The constructor call dict(dict1) creates a new dict that contains the same key/value pairs as dict1.
# Thus, dict2 is not the same object as dict1. When we change the value associated with the 'Monty Python'
# key in dict2, we don't see a corresponding change in dict1.

# This code demonstrates that two identical objects aren't necessarily the same object. If you assign an object
# associated with variable a to variable b, the variables share that object. However, if the value assigned to b is
# an entirely new object, there is no sharing, even if the values are identical.

# Expected output:

# The Life of Brian
