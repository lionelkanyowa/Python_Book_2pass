# Q.1: In your own words, explain the difference between these two expressions.

my_object1 == my_object2
my_object1 is my_object2

# The expression is line 3 uses the == operator to compare and see if my_object1 and my_object2 contain the same
# values or not. Returns true when the values are the same and false otherwise.

# The expression in line 4 uses the `is` operator to compare the objects. Returns true if the objects are the same,
# and returns false otherwise.
